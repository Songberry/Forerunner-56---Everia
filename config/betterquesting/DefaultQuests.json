I wanted it to be the kind of experience where you can really settle down, build, explore, and have a lot of fun in the process.\n\n§eI hope you can take your time to read through each quest, soak up the atmosphere, and enjoy the sci-fi story and characters.\n\n§fDon\u0027t be afraid to build yourself a big house, furnish it, plant gardens, and create a working farm. \n\nYou can teleport everywhere if you want to, but you may prefer to travel by foot, or on horseback, and build yourself little safehouses as you go.\n\nThe storyline is intentionally §enot§f restricted to one particular world or seed so that you can play this modpack on any random worldgen, or on your favourite seed. I thought this would be more immersive as the Forerunners are sent to completely random planets, and it also means you can play the game again on a new random world if you want to.\n\n§bI really hope this can be a very relaxing game for you to play, and that Everia can become a place you look forward to visiting after a stressful day. \n\n§fThank you for playing :)\n\n§c- SongBerry\n\n"

I have your brief here for Stage 3 whenever you\u0027re ready to proceed. \n\nWe really need to know more about the local population already living on Everia, but it\u0027s information we can only get from first-hand observation. Orbital observation just isn\u0027t accurate enough. \n\n§eWhat species are they? What level of tech do they have? Are they peaceful or aggressive?§b At this stage we just have no idea and we need you to be our eyes and ears on the ground.\n\nLocate one of the villages on Everia and just §eobserve §bfor a while, your HUD will upload any relevant data to us. We\u0027re beaming down parts for assembling a glider if that helps with finding a suitable village. \n\nIf you think it\u0027s safe you are authorised to go ahead and try to interact with the local populace. You probably won\u0027t understand the language, but you may be able to trade with them and build trust that way. \n\nWe\u0027re beaming down some items that statistically have a good trade value among primitive cultures. You can also use them as gifts. Our scans indicate they can all be readily obtained on Everia so you won\u0027t risk influencing native technology levels there.  \n\nAnyway just head out there first and observe, and we\u0027ll analyze your data and send back additional instructions.\n\nThanks Forerunner 56. Quinn over and out.\"\n\n\n\n"

We all hope you\u0027re doing well down there. \n\nYou\u0027ve become quite the hero both here at Headquarters and across the Empire! The newcast beams progress reports about all the Forerunners once a week. \n\nOf the 122 at the start of the program did you know there are now §eonly 36 of you left?§b Most didn\u0027t make it past the survival stage, and even more died during the exploration and first contact stages.\n\nVery sad. Very sad indeed. But then that was part of the challenge I guess. You\u0027re currently in 5th place on the leaderboards up here which means you should already have enough credits to buy your own small planet when you get back! So just make sure you stay alive and make it back ok?\n\nAnyway I have your next assignment ready. We\u0027ve finished analysing all the data and§e Everia has officially been tagged for inclusion in the Empire\u0027s portfolio of Protected Planets. §b\n\nIt will mean both the planet and her inhabitants will have the full protection and resources of the Empire, but will not be subject to the usual industrialisation. Everia will be like a kind of planet-sized natural reserve you could say.\n\nHowever before the Government is willing to start on the mountain of §cred tape§b involved they need some idea of what the land can produce.\n\nIt\u0027s to do with funding - if Everia can sustainably produce enough food for the explorers, research teams, and eventually tourists who will visit her, then the Empire can allocate more funding to other things like building her orbital defense grid. But if they have to budget for constantly beaming resources down they\u0027ll have to allocate more funding to that.\n\nSo your §enext assignment §bForerunner is to collect and grow local seeds and saplings to test the soil and growing conditions on Everia. Our Exozoologists have also asked if you could capture some of the local animals and attempt to domesticate them. We\u0027re  beaming down a few things to help you get started.\n\nAlso we know this is a BIG job, one that may even take a few seasons. Our climate techs are strongly recommending you build yourself a sturdy shelter if you haven\u0027t already. \n\n§eA small house would be ideal §b- somewhere both you and the materials you\u0027re collecting can stay dry and safe. You may also need to build shelters for the various animals you capture and breed.\n\nWe\u0027re all very excited to see how you progress! We\u0027re beaming down some supplies to help you with this directive. Good luck 56! Quinn over and out.\"\n\n\n"

For example - to get a lemon sapling you would need to combine three lemons with one jungle sapling. An apple sapling would need three apples and one oak sapling.\n\nFor more information visit http://harvestcraftmod.wikia.com/wiki/Trees\n\n\n"

It was a great celebration last night! The only bad thing about it was you weren\u0027t there :(\n\nAnyway, we\u0027ve finally finished the big report, including our analysis of all the produce samples you sent through. I have to say their quality is better than we could have hoped. The soil and growing conditions there must be fantastic.\n\nMy whole team want to pass on their congratulations for doing such a great job with your farm. You\u0027ve proven that Everia can sustainably produce her own quality food. \n\nAs soon as our report is finished we\u0027ll be forwarding it to the Government so they can officially kick off the process of making Everia a Protected Planet.\n\nWe\u0027ll have one final assignment for you soon, but in the meantime please take some time to rest. We\u0027re beaming down some things from home we thought you might enjoy. A very large payment has also been credited to your account. \n\nTalk to you soon Forerunner, and again - amazing work! Janis over and out.\"\n\n\n"

We hope everything is going really well with your farm. Your bio readings just blipped here, wanted to make sure you\u0027re still ok? Seems to be freaking out about some kind of bacteria... hmm let me take a look on the screen here...\"\n\n§fThere\u0027s silence for a few minutes while Quinn examines whatever it is that\u0027s causing your biofilters to flip out.\n\n§b\"Yep it\u0027s not liking something you have on your hands, some kind of mild bacteria combined with very high amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium??\"\n\n§fYou look down at your hands which seem to have a few brown marks on them... hmm yeah, that\u0027d be chicken poop. You swap all the eggs to one hand and awkwardly type a reply to Quinn. \n\n§b\"Ah, of course! Animal dung. Why didn\u0027t I think of that. Sorry Forerunner, we just don\u0027t get much exposure to nature on that level here at the Capital. \n\nI\u0027m surprised the computer didn\u0027t pick it up though. I\u0027ll double-check the algorithms. You may want to scrub your biofilters too, they must be due for a clean if bacteria is starting to get through.\n\nOh, that reminds me, if you\u0027re at the stage now where your animals are producing food items could you please cook a few things and beam them through? That way our food techs can start analysing the nutritional composition of Everian food for inclusion in the report.\n\nThanks 56. Stay safe! Quinn over and out.\"\n\n\n \n\n"

Quinn here. We\u0027re just receiving the last of your produce samples now - thank you!!\n\nYou know it\u0027s been kinda nice to know that while we\u0027ve been working hard on the report up here, you\u0027ve been working hard down there to send us what we need to finish it.\n\nSo again, from the whole team - thank you Forerunner.\n\nWe\u0027ll have the report done by the end of the week and then we\u0027re going to throw a little celebration party, and we were wondering... if you might be interested in cooking some special Evarian party food for us to include :)??\n\nIt would just be §eSO awesome §bto have actual dishes and drinks here straight from Everia and prepared by YOU, the HERO of Evaaaaaria!\"\n\n§fQuinn laughs, and you can hear her team in the background giggling at the sight of their leader being so dramatic.\n\n§b\"Ahem, anyway, yes. This is completely optional of course Forerunner, but if you\u0027re interested just beam the enclosed list of dishes to us by the end of the week and we\u0027ll beam you back some goodies from the party and a few surprises :).\n\nOk I\u0027d better get back to it.

I think after this we may finally be able to get funding approved for better long-range scanning tech.\n\nAnyway, come visit us at PSH sometime, we\u0027d all love to meet you in person and buy you a drink.\n\nOh! I almost forgot! The scores are finally in from all the Forerunners. I\u0027ll forward them to you after this. Without spoiling anything I\u0027m just going to say - congratulations, and I think you\u0027re going to love your prize :)!\n\nWell I\u0027d better get back to it, so much data to catalogue, so little time.\n\nThanks for the adventure 56!!\n\nQuinn over and out.\"\n\n\n"
